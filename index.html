            <h2 class="lb-heading">Mortarion - The Death Lord</h2>
            <p class="lb-test">Mortarion, also known as the "Pale King," the "Death Lord" or the "Prince of Decay" after he turned to Chaos, was one of the original twenty Imperial primarchs created by the Emperor of Mankind.
            He was given command of the Death Guard Space Marine Legion on the arrival of the Emperor to his homeworld of Barbarus, but he turned to the service of Chaos during the Horus Heresy.
            At present, Mortarion is the greatest Daemon Prince of Nurgle and the Daemon Primarch of the Death Guard Chaos Space Marines.
            He recently returned to Imperial space for the first time in ten thousand standard years when he led the forces of the Plague God in the invasion of the Realm of Ultramar during the Plague Wars.</p>

            <h2 class="lb-heading">Magnus the Red - The Crimson King</h2>
            <p class="lb-test">Magnus the Red, also known during the early years of the Imperium as the "Crimson King" and the "Red Cyclops," is the primarch of the Thousand Sons Traitor Legion and an extremely powerful Daemon Prince of the Chaos God Tzeentch.
            A giant in both physical and mental terms whilst still an inhabitant of the Materium, the copper-skinned Magnus possessed tremendous innate psychic ability, and constantly sought to understand the nature of the Warp, becoming a sorcerer of formidable power.</p>

            <h2 class="lb-heading">Angron - The Red Angel</h2>
            <p class="lb-test">Angron, sometimes called the "Red Angel," and originally named Angronius of Nuceria, the "Lord of the Red Sands," is the primarch of the World Eaters Traitor Legion.
            He was the most bloody-handed and savage of the primarchs. When Horus began his rebellion against the Emperor, Angron was quick to join in his treachery because of his long-lasting grudge against the Master of Mankind for the Emperor's failure to rescue his beloved fellow enslaved gladiators from death on his homeworld of Nuceria, but his only true master was the rage and bloodlust within him.
            He fell to Chaos during the Horus Heresy and was transformed into a Daemon Prince of the Blood God Khorne in the campaign known as the Shadow Crusade before that conflict had ended.</p>

            <h2 class="lb-heading">Fulgrim - The Phoenician</h2>
            <p class="lb-test">Fulgrim, also known in the time before the Horus Heresy as "The Phoenician," is the primarch of the Emperor's Children Traitor Legion. He possessed silvery-white hair and was quite vainglorious, as his entire life was dedicated to the pursuit of perfection in all things; physical, mental and spiritual. Today, Fulgrim is a four-armed, serpentine Daemon Prince of Slaanesh who is believed to reside on a Daemon World called Callax somewhere within the Eye of Terror or within the Realm of Chaos itself.</p>
